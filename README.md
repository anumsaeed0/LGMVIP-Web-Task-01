## To Do List Web App

Welcome to the To Do List Web App repository! This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly task management tool. Below is an overview of the app's key features:

1. The web app is aptly titled "My To Do List," reflecting its primary purpose of organizing tasks effectively.

2. The app incorporates an eye-catching image that gracefully hides on mobile and tablet devices, ensuring seamless user experience across various screen sizes.

3. A thoughtfully placed input box under the heading allows users to set a daily motivational message or a reminder to stay focused.

4. The core functionality revolves around a dynamic task list. Users can input their tasks into a dedicated box and utilize the "Add Task" button to seamlessly integrate new tasks into the list.

5. The To Do List Web App provides three essential task management options:
   - Add: Easily add tasks to the list for better organization.
   - Done: Marked completed tasks to keep track of achievements.
   - Remove: Effortlessly remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.

With these intuitive features, managing your daily tasks becomes a breeze!

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project's enhancement. We believe in the power of collaboration and continuous improvement. Let's make task management simpler and more efficient together!

That's all for now! Happy task organizing!
